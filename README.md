Bokeh Effect in Image using Python
===================


Bokeh is the Japanese word which means Blur. Bokeh tends to the region which we choose to out of focus. This effect makes the in-focus image so vibrant and clear to eyes which makes the photo looks more elegant. Now a days, This can be achieved easily with the help of DSLRs at the time of capturing but If we wish to achieve this later then we need to use photoshops or other photo editing software.

but Today I would like to share how to achieve Bokeh effect in Python

if you are intrested in the working behind the program then visit [py2py](https://py2py.com/bokeh-effect-in-image-using-python/)
